<h1>John Collison</h1>
<h2>Co-founder of Stripe</h2>
<img src="jc.png">
In 2007, Collison founded "Shuppa" with his brother Patrick Collison in Limerick, Ireland. The company later merged with Auctomatic, which was funded by Y Combinator, and Collison moved to Silicon Valley. Auctomatic was a software company that built tools for the eBay platform. The company was also funded by Chris Sacca. Auctomatic was acquired for $5 million in March 2008, when Collison was 17.<br><br>
In 2009, Collison (having returned to finish secondary school at Castletroy College) scored 10 A grades in the Irish Leaving Certificate examination. At 980 points, this was the highest-ever CAO score received by a student sitting the Leaving Certificate. He continued to study at Harvard University, commencing his studies in September 2009.
<br><br>
Collison is also a pilot and a pianist.<br><br>
In 2010, John cofounded Stripe, which received backing from Peter Thiel, Elon Musk and Sequoia Capital.

<h1>Kulveer Taggar</h1>
<h2>Co-founder of Tagstand</h2>
<img src="kt.jpg" width="300px">
Kulveer Taggar is a British entrepreneur who was the CEO of Auctomatic, a start-up he co-founded with Harjeet Taggar and Patrick Collison. In 2008, he gained international press coverage when he sold the company for $5 million at the age of 24.
<br><br>
Previously he was a BBC columnist and Deutsche Bank banker.
<br><br>
From a TC article on Tagstand: Tagstand offers to ship custom NFC stickers within less than 24 hours (plus however long it takes to ship them). And they’re also making the tags “smart” by offering a bit.ly-like short URL service that’ll let you track when each one is used. Each sticker runs around $1, which seems to be around what other sites are charging for small batches.
<br><br>
The short-URL feature is pretty straightforward: when you place your order, Tagstand will associate each sticker with a unique URL. Then, once you receive your stickers, you can log into the site’s dashboard and configure where you’d like each of these short URLs to point to (the upshot to this is that you can change the URL even once the stickers are deployed in the field). The site also provides analytics on how often each of these stickers is used.
